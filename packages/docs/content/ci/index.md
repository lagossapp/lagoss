# Automatic deployment using CI

You can use your existing CI system to automatically deploy your project to lagoss.

Currently following CI systems are supported, but most other systems should work by using the [@lagoss/cli](../cli.md):

- [Github actions](github-actions.md)
- [Gitlab CI](gitlab-ci.md)
- [Woodpecker CI](woodpecker.md)
