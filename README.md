## About

Lagoss is a fork of [Lagon](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon) an open-source runtime and platform that allows developers to run TypeScript and JavaScript Serverless Functions.

> [!NOTE]
> The project was forked from [Lagon](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon) with the
> intention to continue development. There is currently a public testing instance
> deployed at <https://app.lagoss.com>. However it should be used for basic
> testing only and data might be deleted at any point. If you want a proper setup,
> please deploy your own instance => [Install my own instance](https://docs.lagoss.com/self-hosting/installation).

## How it works

Lagoss uses V8 Isolates, which are sandboxed environments used to run plain JavaScript. That means each Function's memory is isolated from each others, and you can run a lot of them at the same time with very few resources. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [Deno](https://deno.land/) (and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) are also using V8 Isolates to execute JavaScript.

Starting an Isolate is a lot faster than starting a whole Node.js process, which allows for almost free cold starts.
